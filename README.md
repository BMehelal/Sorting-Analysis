# Sorting Analysis 

## Comparing Efficiency and Performance of Sorting Algorithms

As the final project for my data structures class, we were tasked with analyzing the performance of various sorting algorithms, including bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, heap sort, and quick sort, by measuring the number of steps and CPU time for each algorithm.

### Task 1

Implementing each method using a sorting, reverse sorting, and random purmutation data input of size n = 100, 300, 500, 1000, 3000, 5000, 10000, and 50000, and calculating the number of steps and CPU time.

### Task 2

For each algorithmn, with input sizes n = 100, 300, 500, 1000, 3000, 5000, 10000, and 50000, calculate the average number of steps and CPU time for 50 random integers.
